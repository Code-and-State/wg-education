## Working group : education üìö

### Motivation üéØ

The [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/) is a novel and complex platform. This novelty comes with challenges in understanding how the platform works, how to build on it, or even how to use it.

There have been attempts at educating the broader community and there are currently several initiatives led by individuals, the [Dfinity Foundation](https://dfinity.org/) or other entities in the ecosystem: [Motoko Bootcamp](https://github.com/motoko-bootcamp), [Code & State](https://www.codeandstate.com/), Internet Computer Fellowship, [Internet Computer Association](https://internetcomputer.org/), and more. Most of those initiatives would greatly benefit from open collaboration.

The goal of this working group is to provide a place for collaboration, discussion and planning of initiatives that serve the broader goal of¬†**educating about the Internet Computer and its ecosystem.**
